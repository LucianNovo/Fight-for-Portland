##Fight-for-Portland


###A locally sourced first person shooter.  


Videogames are fun because they simulate unreal fantasies- but very few emulate your surroundings and allow you to do whatever you want with them.I wanted to play in the mundane places that I live so I created FightForPortland, an FPS based in the cultural heart of the NW.

Itâ€™s currently simple- you can race around Downtown Portland at incredibly fast speeds, shoot rectangular bullets, and jump from building to building. As long as somebody else connects to the server you can also start an error prone multiplayer game.
